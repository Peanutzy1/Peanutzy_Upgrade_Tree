# Welcome to my engine

## i wanted to make: incremental game
- insparations: roblox incremental games

## i am masochistic for the reason below:
- i use c + wasm + webgl for the stack
- i do data oriented design
- i want this to scale on about 30-60k entities
- yes i know i wont be making a game for an eternity until this engine is done

- might as well call it eternity for the professional name because of im suffering for a while

## TO DOS
- actually have a clicky button on a zoomable pannable canvas
